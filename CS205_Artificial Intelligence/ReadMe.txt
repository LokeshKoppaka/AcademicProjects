* This File holds projects implemented for Artificial Intelligence course
   > EightPuzzle - Implemented A* algorithm in Java to solve 8 puzzle problem
   > FeatureSelection - Implemented forward selection and backward feature selection for KNN, compared their performance.
                      - Further improved the algorithm using alpha - beta pruning, pushing misclassified records to the front and improved                         search speed by "92%"
